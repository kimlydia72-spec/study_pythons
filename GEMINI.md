# Project Overview

This directory, `study_pythons`, appears to be a collection of educational materials for learning the Python programming language. It contains a series of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts, each focusing on a specific concept.

## Key Files

*   `codes/01_variables_string.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook covering Python strings.
*   `codes/02_variables_list.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook covering Python lists.
*   `codes/03_variables_dict.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook covering Python dictionaries.
*   `codes/04_variables_bundles.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook covering Python tuples and other data structures.
*   `codes/05_ifs.py`: A Python script demonstrating conditional `if` statements.
*   `codes/06_whiles.py`: A Python script demonstrating `while` loops.

## Usage

The files in this directory are intended for self-paced learning of Python. The Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) can be run in a Jupyter environment to interactively execute the code and see the results. The Python scripts (`.py` files) can be executed directly from the command line.
